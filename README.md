### Notebooks


<The current goal is to perform a EDA around the existing data for Gitcoin Grants, which have a graph-like structure.>

## Background information & concepts addressed
### What does this cadCAD model do


## What is cadCAD?
cadCAD (complex adaptive dynamics Computer-Aided Design) is a python based modeling framework for research, validation, and Computer Aided Design of complex systems. Given a model of a complex system, cadCAD can simulate the impact that a set of actions might have on it. This helps users make informed, rigorously tested decisions on how best to modify or interact with the system in order to achieve their goals. cadCAD supports different system modeling approaches and can be easily integrated with common empirical data science workflows. Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping features are natively supported and optimized for.

### Model Reproducibility
In order to reperform this code, we recommend the researcher use the following link https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual to download Python 3.7. To install the specific version of cadCAD this repository was built with, run the following code: pip install cadCAD==0.4.23

Then run cd Aragon_Conviction_Voting to enter the repository. Finally, run jupyter notebook to open a notebook server to run the various notebooks in this repository.
